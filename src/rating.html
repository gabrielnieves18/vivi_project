			<h1> Review: Lisbeth Salander, Blunted in Tooth and Claw </h1>
			<h5>Rating: 1.5/4 </h5>

			<p>
				<br>
				Even the tattoo is worse.
				One of the signatures of Lisbeth Salander, the hacker-heroine of the Millennium series, is her tattoo of a dragon, which has morphed as the screen franchise has, too. In the original Swedish movie of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” an inky monster covers a huge swath of Salander’s pale back, its teeth and long claws angling for a fight. In David Fincher’s Hollywood take, a kinetic, ferocious-looking dragon drapes over Salander’s left shoulder, its leathery wings dynamically folded and long tail winding down the side of her back.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the latest and emptiest Salander screen vehicle, “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” the dragon perches on Salander’s back, its wings fanned and mouth open, like a hungry baby bird. The dragon looks as if it paused in midflight to catch a worm or pose for a coat of arms. It’s as blankly ornamental as the rest of the movie, which stars Claire Foy as a preposterously jacked-up version of the renegade hacker. Salander is still typing furiously and retains a taste for black clothes and vengeance, but her running and gunning now suggest a Goth cosplaying James Bond.
				It’s an insulting development for such an original character, who no matter how poorly translated on the page or on to the screen has managed to stir the imagination. As her best moments underscore, Salander isn’t memorable simply because of her hacking or her ability to take down a male assailant twice her size, but because she exists outside of familiar binary classification. An amalgam of gender stereotypes distilled into one rough yet slippery package, she isn’t fragile or ferocious, victim or predator, feminine or masculine. She’s both, which means she’s neither, one reason it has been hard for mainstream cinema (with its his or her boxes) to turn her into coherent cinematic brand.
				<br>
				<br>
				Here, that unclassifiable quality has been blunted and contained, and Salander made into another blandly tough chick. It’s a bad fit for the character and for Foy, though the fault is scarcely the actress’s. Foy is best known for the Netflix series “The Crown,” in which she plays the young Queen Elizabeth II, a role that allowed her to express her range with intricate subtlety. She’s cut loose since, going flamboyantly big as a psychiatric patient in Steven Soderbergh’s “Unsane.” For “Spider’s Web,” Foy has been tamped down again. This time, though, little nuance seeps through the mask she wears (or her vaguely accented English), for which the filmmakers deserve the blame.
				<br>
				<br>
				Just don’t take it out on Stieg Larsson, who originated the Millennium trilogy and died in 2004, the year before the first novel was published. The movie is based on the first of two follow-ups by David Lagercrantz, also titled (in English) “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” suggesting that this character is too lucrative to ever properly mature to womanhood. A few itsy-bitsy spiders pop up, and Salander spins a web for a very bad man in his own hidey hole, stringing him upside down in the name of, well, something (just don’t call it feminism). From then on, she takes turns playing pursuer or pursued in a tangled tale that brings together old loves, family horrors, state secrets and life on Earth.

			<h1> Review: Peter Sobczynski, Roger Ebert </h1>
			<h5>Rating: 1.5/4 </h5>

			<p>
				<br>
				 The original Swedish-language adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s phenomenally successful novel “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” was not an especially great film by most cinematic standards—it was directed in an efficient though relatively nondescript manner that didn’t always hide the occasional clunkiness of the narrative—but it contained a performance by Noomi Rapace as troubled hacker genius Lisbeth Salander that was so focused and driven and compelling that it single-handedly elevated the proceedings to the level of compulsively watchable. When David Fincher did his surprisingly by-the-book big-budget studio version of the story soon afterwards, it still had the lumpy storyline as well as a performance by Rooney Mara as Salander that, while perfectly adequate in its own right, could not begin to hold a candle to Rapace’s stunning take on the part. However, Fincher directed it with such elegance and precision—without tamping down any of the edgier elements in order to make things more palatable to the masses—that it also resulted in a film that was much better than it had any real right to be. Now, having skipped over the two follow-up books that Larsson himself wrote before his death (and considering the weakness of the Swedish film adaptations, that was probably a good idea), the English-language version of the franchise is being relaunched with “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” and this time around, the resulting film features all of the dubious qualities of the previous entries listed above without any of the virtues.
				<br>
				<br>
				Based on a novel by David Lagercrantz, the writer hired by Larsson’s family to create new stories, the film takes place three years after the events of “Dragon Tattoo” and finds Lisbeth (now played by Claire Foy) working as a sort of avenging angel for abused women everywhere—she is introduced to us as she ties up a slick businessman with a penchant for beating women and transfers his bank account holdings to the wife he has just smacked around, before applying a Taser to his genitals. However, she is still a hacker first and foremost and when she is offered a seemingly impossible job to do by former NSA employee Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant), she cannot resist the urge to take it. It seems that Balder invented a computer program named Firefall that gives the person using it the power to hack virtually any nuclear missile system in the world. After getting it up and running, however, it dawns on him that this was probably not a good idea and so he wants Lisbeth to steal it away from the NSA computers and hide it. This proves to be easy enough but someone else is on the trail as well and steals her computer before blowing up her apartment with her in it.
				<br>
				<br>
				She survives but is sufficiently distracted to miss her meeting with Balder and his young son, August (Christopher Convery) and Balder, deciding he has made another mistake, throws himself on the mercy of the Swedish Secret Service, whose deputy director (Synnove Macody Lund) hides them away in a safe house. Having learned from her one-time ally, crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sevrrir Gudnason), that those responsible for the bombing are connected to the Russians, Lisbeth begins her own surveillance of the safe house and when Swedish security proves to be less than it is cracked up to be, she ends up rescuing August and, with the aid of Blomkvist and Edwin Needham (Lakeith Stanfield), another NSA agent trying to retrieve Firefall, trying to figure out who is behind it all. When that person turns up (played by Sylvia Hoeks), her identity turns out to hit Lisbeth a lot closer to home than expected.
				<br>
				<br>
				The title sequence of “The Girl in the Spider’s Web” deliberately evokes the highly stylized ones designed by the late, great Maurice Binder that used to preface the James Bond movies. In a way, this is appropriate since the film itself evokes old Bond movies more than anything else, specifically the weaker ones that tended to throw in lots of elaborate action set pieces and gadgetry in an attempt to disguise the fact that they didn’t have much of a story to offer. The film is chock-full of kinetic action throughout—ranging from car chases to elaborate fight scenes to the last-minute discovery that the NSA tech guy is also a crack sniper—and while director Fede Alvarez stages them in a slick and efficient manner, they don’t really seem to have any connection to the elements that attracted people to the Lisbeth Salander stories in the first place—do you know anyone who emerged from “Dragon Tattoo” raving about the fight choreography? On the bright side, they do serve as distractions for the genuinely terrible story that is dribbled out in between them. This is the kind of tension-free thriller that requires even the most seemingly intelligent of characters to act like absolute morons in order to get from one clumsy plot point to the next. When audiences cringed at “Dragon Tattoo,” it was in response to some nasty business. When they cringe here, it's the result of yet more ham-handed storytelling.

			<h1> Review: Robert Daniels, 812filmreviews</h1>
			<h5>Rating: 1.5/4 </h5>

			<p>
				<br>
				The Girl in the Spider’s Web is technically the second film within the series (if we only count the American iteration). Director Fede Alvarez‘s new take on David Fincher’s previous work, is essentially a worse version of Skyfall.Lisbeth Salander, originally played by Rooney Mara, has morphed into Claire Foy. Salander is still an avenging arch-angel, a vigilante defending those who cannot defend themselves. She’s a secluded tatted punk who hangs at clubs for women to pick up, often using them to patch away her own guilt and trauma.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Girl in the Spider’s Web, when it’s at its best, is a film about guilt. In an attempt to re-launch the franchise, the film opens with a young Salander playing chess with her sister Camilla. As we know, Lisbeth’s father was a killer, torturer, and pedophile, routinely raping his daughters. When Lisbeth and Camilla are called to their father’s room, Lisbeth attempts to save her sister—running to their home’s broken ledge overlooking a hill. Lisbeth jumps to escape, but Camilla stays with her father.
				<br>
				<br>
				Flash-forward to the present day and we find that Lisbeth lives on the outskirts of town. She has multiple safe houses and still trusts no one, not even the journalist Mikael Blomkvist (previously played by Daniel Craig, here he’s portrayed by Sverrir Gudnason). Their relationship is complicated, and Mikael’s ordinariness makes his placement in what amounts to a spy thriller useless.
				<br>
				<br>
				Nevertheless, the two are thrown into contact again through Lisbeth helping a weapons designer steal back his nuke launching computer program from the NSA (telling you, this is James Bond in everything but name). Lisbeth is successful, but the program is stolen from her, her place is blown up, the designer (Stephen Merchant) and his son (Christopher Convery) are in witness protection, she has the police on her tail, and an NSA operative, Edwin Needham (Lakeith Stanfield), has come to Sweden to hunt her down.
				<br>
				<br>
				The film never delivers on the excitement that the above provokes. Every actor here is wasted. You’d be hard pressed to find a better cast in a more lackluster film. No character is emotionally sketched beyond their first few seconds on screen. Instead, Spider’s Web relies on us giving more emotion to these characters through a previously unconnected film than through its own script.
				<br>
				<br>
				Also, for a film that wants to sell itself on female empowerment, the women in the film are underutilized. Vicky Krieps plays Erika Berger, Mickael’s current girlfriend/lover. Here, Krieps portrays another character who fauns over a man, but unlike Phantom Thread, she finds little emotional autonomy. Instead, she’s wasted in a useless bit part. The villain, played by Sylvia Hoeks, never goes beyond being a generic, scorned, and damaged evildoer. Even Lisbeth has a bit of her sheen taken away. In previous iterations, the character was unique. Here, you could cycle her out with Lara Croft and I wouldn’t know the difference.
				<br>
				<br>
				The film’s flaws make sense when you consider that The Girl in the Spider’s Web is the first adaption that doesn’t originate from author Stieg Larsson (Larsson died of a heart attack in 2004). Instead, this iteration was written by David Lagercrantz in 2015. Lisbeth’s journey very much mirrors that of James Bond in Skyfall (2012). The Swedish title of The Girl in the Spider’s Web is “That which does not kill us.” Spider’s Web would be a better filmed if it honed in on this sentiment, but it doesn’t. Instead, it has competing aesthetic styles: raw techno feel (almost John Wick-ish) and the dark emotional reckoning. The two cannot survive together, and what results is a tonal mess.
				<br>
				<br>
				The film is almost single handedly kept afloat because of Foy. Even through a screenplay whose turns and contrivances become more unbearable and outlandish by the second, she delivers with purpose, lines whose only purpose lies in her ability to deliver them. When Lisbeth finally confronts her past, it only makes us wish that more of the film followed its melancholic and trauma-riddled sequence. It makes us wish Foy was given the entirety of the The Girl in the Spider’s Web to shape and explore the inner-psyche of this “spy.” Instead, and unfortunately, The Girl in the Spider’s Web is a generic cash grab that lacks the unique artistry required for a strong female lead.
